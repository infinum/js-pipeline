# Next vs React

The reasoning behind why Next.js is a special case of React:

* Next.js gives us some defaults that we can use to simplify the configuration
* Next.js enables us some extra optimizations (e.g. next cache) to speed up the build time
* Next.js has some specific logic around deployment (e.g. preparing the standalone build)
